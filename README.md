By Candice Wu

## I. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this statistical analysis is to examine the relationship between various
economic variables and the 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States
(MORTGAGE30US). In this analysis, I aim to investigate the impact of these
independent variables on the mortgage rate and determine which variables have a
significant relationship with MORTGAGE30US. Additionally, I will address challenges
such as multicollinearity and skewness in the dataset, performing appropriate
techniques to mitigate their effects. The findings of this analysis will contribute to a
better understanding of the factors influencing mortgage rates in the United States
